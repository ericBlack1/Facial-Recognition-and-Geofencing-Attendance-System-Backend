### üß© **Core Backend Features**

#### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**

* User registration (students, instructors, admins)
* Password-based login
* Biometric login (via facial recognition)
* Role-based access control (students, instructors, admins)
* Secure session/token handling (OAuth2 / JWT)

#### 2. **User Management**

* Student profile creation and updates (personal, academic, and biometric data)
* Instructor and admin account management
* User role assignment and verification
* User existence checks during registration

#### 3. **Facial Recognition Integration**

* Facial image upload & storage
* Integration with facial recognition engine (cloud/on-device)
* Match face embeddings in real-time during check-in
* Handle alignment feedback and check-in success/failure response

#### 4. **Attendance Management**

* Facial recognition-based check-in endpoint
* Geo-fencing verification (GPS location validation)
* Manual override attendance endpoint for instructors
* Attendance record creation, updates, and retrieval

#### 5. **Geo-Fencing & Location Services**

* Integration with mapping APIs (e.g., Google Maps/OpenStreetMap)
* Define and update geo-fenced classroom boundaries
* Validate user location during check-in
* Admin API to update classroom locations

#### 6. **Dashboards & Analytics**

* Student dashboard API:

  * View attendance stats, history, upcoming classes
  * Permission request submission with evidence uploads
* Instructor dashboard API:

  * View attendance trends, charts, and anomalies
  * Highlight absentees
* Admin analytics endpoints:

  * Course-wide or institution-wide attendance metrics

#### 7. **Reporting & Filtering**

* Filtering attendance by:

  * Course
  * Date
  * Student
* Export or aggregate reports (CSV, JSON, etc.)

#### 8. **Notification System**

* Integration with FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) or similar
* Real-time push notifications for:

  * Attendance status
  * Missed check-ins
  * Manual overrides
  * System alerts
* Parent notification system for absences

#### 9. **Permission Requests**

* Endpoint for students to submit absence justifications
* File upload handling (e.g., medical reports)

### üîí **Security & Compliance Features**

* OAuth2 / JWT-based secure authentication
* HTTPS/TLS enforcement for all API traffic
* Secure biometric data handling (face image encryption)
* Role-based permissions enforcement on each API route
* Secure database access with input validation and sanitization

---

### üóÉÔ∏è **Data Storage & Integration**

* **Database support**:

  * PostgreSQL (relational data: users, courses, attendance)
  * Firebase Realtime DB or MongoDB (real-time updates, biometric data)
* **Cloud storage**:

  * Store facial images or biometric data securely (if needed)
* **Offline sync support**:

  * Queued check-ins for unstable internet, sync when online

---

### üöÄ **Performance and Scalability**

* Optimized queries and indexing for 1000+ concurrent users
* Redis or memory cache for frequently accessed data (like GPS boundaries)
* Background job handling (e.g., notification delivery, sync jobs)

---

### üì± **Mobile App API Support**

* REST or GraphQL API for all frontend interactions
* Secure API communication using HTTPS
* Lightweight payloads for fast responses (e.g., ‚â§5 seconds check-in)

---

### üß† **AI/ML Model Integration (Facial Recognition Engine)**

* Support for embedding generation and real-time comparison
* Optional use of third-party APIs (AWS Rekognition, Face++ etc.)
* Feedback system for check-in failure/success in real-time
